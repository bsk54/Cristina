Christina's Language Garden (CLG) is an innovative web-based platform designed to accelerate language learning through immersive, sound-enhanced vocabulary lists.

At the heart of CLG is a comprehensive word management system that allows users to effortlessly add, edit, and delete vocabulary lists. Users can import new words, append to existing lists, export current lists, and back up or restore all lists from files.

CLG is the pocket version of Word Siren (see https://github.com/bsk54/wordsiren.git).

While Word Siren was designed for use on the computer, CLG was created to provide an efficient and enjoyable platform for daily learning on the go.
